Bit manipulation in c
- convert a binary number to an unsigned int
- print the binary of a number without using / or %
- return the value of a bit at a given index
- set the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
- set the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
- return the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
- check for big endian and little endian
